Welcome to the **Dog Adoption Website**! This platform helps users find their perfect furry friend by displaying a curated list of dogs available for adoption.

## ✨ Features

- **Random Dog Selection** – Displays 8 randomly chosen dogs from the Supabase dog database.
- **Admin Portal** – Allows admins to **add** or **remove** dogs, with random pictures and breeds generated from the Dog API.
- **Breed Search** – Users can search for dogs of a specific breed and view relevant results.

## 🛠 How It Was Made

This website was built using **Next.js** for the frontend and **Supabase** as the backend database. The **Dog API** is used to generate random dog images and breeds. The platform allows users to browse available dogs, while admins can manage dog listings easily.
